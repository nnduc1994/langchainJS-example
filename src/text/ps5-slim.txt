PlayStation 5 Shoppers if you're

thinking about a console wait Sony just

announced a new one what does this mean

for your holiday shopping well Sony's

got a thin PlayStation 5 that's coming

out in November the PS5 originally came

out in 2020 and the new PS5 or PS5 slim

as a lot of people will call it is 30%

smaller according to Sony and it's also

18 to 24% less heavy so this is

definitely a console that looks like

it's going to fit a little bit easier in

your home entertainment bookshelf cu the

PS5 is a pretty big console that's

similar to what Sony's done before

PlayStation 4 slim and PS2 slim and I

feel like it goes all the way back but

there's no price change here $500 when

this console comes out in November or

$450 for the digital version one cool

and one not cool thing about the digital

diskless version so the nice thing is

that the $450 new discus version could

get an Ultra HD Blu-ray Drive later a

Snap-On module son's finally offering

that for $80 more but the console is

more expensive whereas the digital was

$400 before the new one is

$450 what's different well besides that

you're really talking about a little bit

more storage and a 1 tbte hard drive and

the smaller size but it should be about

the same performance as the existing

PlayStation 5 Sony's telling people to

just be aware of it this happened right

in the middle of prime Day by the way so

click clearly a message to anyone who's

shopping and apparently the new consoles

are going to replace the older ones over

time one more thing to keep in mind

about these new consoles though is they

will require new stand and skin

accessories the existing replaceable

shells that Sony has been selling for

while for the PlayStation 5 won't work

with the new Slimmer one and also

there's a new vertical stand that Sony

is selling for

$30 that's annoying but if you have a

new design that's probably expected

Sony's already got a lot of other

Hardware out there the PlayStation

portal a handheld second screen is

coming out in November there's a

PlayStation VR2 that came out in

February and which PlayStation do you

get well in the long run there's only

going to be one PlayStation 5 model this

new thinner digital or disc added one

that's going to be everywhere worldwide

I would think about waiting for that one

because it would be nice to have a

smaller console and it's really nice to

have a digital one where you could add

the disc later if you wanted to even if

you're paying a little bit more money

for it but stay tuned for our full

review we'll let you know more and if
